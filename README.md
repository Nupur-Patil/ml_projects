Machine Learning Portfolio: Mini-Projects
ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This repository serves as a professional portfolio showcasing various machine learning projects, from classic classification/regression tasks to more advanced techniques. The primary goal is to demonstrate proficiency in the complete ML lifecycle, including:

Data Sourcing and Preprocessing (e.g., ETL pipelines, feature engineering)

Model Development (e.g., model selection, hyperparameter tuning)

Reproducibility (e.g., environment management, clear directory structure)

Model Evaluation and Reporting

Each subdirectory contains a standalone project, complete with its own detailed README.md, environment dependencies, and clear script-based workflow.
